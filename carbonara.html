    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish originating from Rome.<br />
      It features spaghetti or another type of pasta coated in a rich, creamy
      sauce made from eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, pancetta or guanciale
      (Italian cured meats), and black pepper.<br />
      The heat from the freshly cooked pasta helps to create a silky sauce
      without curdling the eggs. Carbonara is known for its simple yet indulgent
      flavor profile.
