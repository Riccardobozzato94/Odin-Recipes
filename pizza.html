    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Pizza is a popular Italian dish that has become a global favorite. It typically consists of a flat, round base of dough topped with tomato sauce, cheese (most commonly mozzarella), and various toppings such as pepperoni, vegetables, mushrooms, and more. Pizza is baked in an oven and can come in many varieties, including thin-crust, deep-dish, and wood-fired styles. Each region in Italy, and around the world, has its own unique take on pizza.
