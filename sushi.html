    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish consisting of vinegared rice combined with various ingredients such as raw fish, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes tropical fruits. It is often served with condiments like soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger. There are different types of sushi, including nigiri (slices of raw fish atop small rice balls), maki (rolled sushi with seaweed on the outside), and sashimi (slices of raw fish without rice).
